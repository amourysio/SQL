# SQL (Structured Query Language) Exam Project From Academy



SQL exam project Creating a database for a football championship.
Groups, teams, footballers, managers, judges, meetings between teams.
In the project I have created requests:
• all players in the team;
• number of wins, draws, and losses per team;
• last meetings of the team by dates;
• all teams with more than half of the matches won.
• a procedure that calculates the number of team points on a date submitted with a
parameter.
